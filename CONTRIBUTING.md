### Signing Your Commits

To sign off your commits, add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages:

```
This is my commit message

```

You can do this automatically by using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

### Configuring Git for Sign-off

Make sure your Git configuration has your name and email set:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Code Style

- For python code: Follow the existing style in the codebase
